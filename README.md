# About Me
Hi, My name is Juan Valencia
I'm currently a part time mobile developer, full time student in East Texas finishing up my last semester for my B.S. in Computer Science. I was born in Medellin, Colombia and am natively fluent in English and Spanish. My goal is to one day architect code that will affect lives in a meaningful way. I am intrigued by big data and machine learning and am trying to learn as much as possible through projects focusing on those topics. I am currently working at [Elliott Electric Supply](https://www.elliottelectric.com/) and can't wait to graduate!

# Side Projects

### Habitat for Humanity Warehouse Inventory System

This is a *proof-of-concept* project for my Database Management systems class where a classmate ( @bargeje ) and I are creating a Django webapp that will allow Habitat for Humanity to manage projects, their warehouse, and the people working on their projects in a simple efficient way.

### Driving Jacks Ride Sharing Infrastructure and Mobile App

This is my biggest project for the end of my undergraduate career. It is a private project however, due to the confidential nature of the data being used. Feel free to [email me](mailto:juan7732@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanruizvalencia/) to discuss the project in more depth. The goal of this project was to learn more about different JavaScript technologies like Node.js and Express.js while providing a service to my community.

# What I do for fun!

Currently, I am at DeveloperWeek Austin and I am pumped to meet new people, discover new technologies such as [HERE location Services](https://www.here.com/en) and [Rev.ai Speech-to-text APIs](https://www.rev.ai/), as well as participating in the hackathon!
